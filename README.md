This project consists of 2 applications: a creation and a listener tool.

The creation tool allows for an intuitive and user friendly creation of a binaural audiobook, where the user can place the sound - most typically a direct speech of a character - into a 3d space with one degree spacing and at 4 different distances (0.5m, 1m, 2m, 3m). Additionally, the user can apply (in its current version) three environmental reverberations (a cave, a forest and a church) onto the sound to increase the realism of the scene.

The listener tool allows for the playback of the audio, while adjusting the positions of the sound according to the creator's intentions, as well as the listener's head rotation in real-time, if a gyroscope is connected. Using Arduino and electronics, we built a pair of headphones with a gyroscope mounted on top to demonstrate this functionality.
